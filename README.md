# Frontend Development Final Review Project

For this project you will build a portfolio website that showcases your projects. You will need to use styled components to create a visually appealing layout. Use React Router to allow users to navigate between different project categories. Use mapping to display the projects on the DOM.

## Project Requirements:
- Technology Stack: The project should be built using React.js, styled components, and React Router.

- Portfolio Layout: The website should have a visually appealing and responsive layout that showcases your projects. You can choose your own color scheme and typography, but the design should be consistent across all pages. Opt for clean, minimalist design if you prefer to do less curation of the styling.

- Styled Components: Use styled components to create reusable UI components such as buttons, headings, and cards. These components should be used throughout the project to maintain a consistent look and feel.

- React Router: Use React Router to allow users to navigate between different project categories. The portfolio should have a homepage, a page for each project category, and a page for each project. Users should be able to access these pages through the navigation bar or by clicking on links.

- Components: Break down the portfolio into smaller components that are easy to maintain and test. Each component should have a clear responsibility and should be reusable across different pages.

- Mapping Data: Use mapping to display the projects on the DOM. Map through the array of project objects and display them as cards on the projects page. Each card should display the project title, image, and description. When a user clicks on a card, they should be taken to the project details page. (You can creat mock data in a file for this)


- Documentation: Document the project in a README file that includes the technology stack, features, and an overview of what you learned.

- Code Quality: Write clean, readable, and maintainable code. Follow best practices for coding style, formatting, and organization.
